<h1>The Best Movies Of All Time!!!</h1>
<h2>Top Three Best Movies Are...</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Qarib Qarib Singlle</h3>
<p>One of the best works of Irrfan. It feels like a rollercoaster of emotions. Packed with a very mature humour and panic! Hope you'll like it too.</p>

<h3>Tamasha</h3>
<p>If you're lost in this fast paced world, everymoment of your life you feel this is not you or you're too good to be here. Then you're gonna experience a cinematic marvel which force you to put yorself as ved(the lost guy) and figure out how to make your own career</p>

<h3>Batman</h3>
<p>A facinating character from the DC comics with loads of action, adventure, thrill, and what not. </p>
